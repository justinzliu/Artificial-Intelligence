# CMPT310: Artificial Intelligence Survey

Provides a unified discussion of the fundamental approaches to the problems in artificial intelligence. The topics considered are: representational typology and search methods; game playing, heuristic programming; pattern recognition and classification; theorem-proving; question-answering systems; natural language understanding; computer vision.

# Programs

### Pacman

Pacman program that accepts problem space and outputs Pacman path given a search algorithm. Search algorithms implemented: depth first search, breadth first search, A* search using manhattan distance heuristic.

### SATsolver

SAT solver program using DPLL algorithm to return an assignment of values that fulfill given clauses. Full implementation of unit propagation, pure literals, and variable selection utilizing least constrained clause heuristic.
